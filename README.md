# Game Of Life - Vue.js + Javascript

An experiment using simple UI over the model.

Game of Life implementation based on [John Horton Conway's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automaton.

## Demo

The UI relies on 3 files:

1. index.html
1. app.js
1. life.js

To view the demo locally you need to run a static web server so that your browser allows running js.

If you are using VS Code, the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) can help you do just that. 

Or just to see in the browser, [go here](https://nurih.github.io/game-of-life/).
